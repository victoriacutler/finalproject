### (1) Solar Is Less Accessible to Lower Income Households
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {

graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

# define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish
node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen]

graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

# define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish
node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen]

results [label = 'monetary costs to \n those without solar']

# edge definitions with the node IDs
costissue -> cost -> results

# **Study Objective**
## Given this, I wanted to take a look at the relationship between income and solar adoption across (1) the whole **United States**, and (2) in **California**, since solar policy reform is underway to help lessen this issue.

# **Data Sources**

- **Solar Data** found [here](https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/data-explorer/featured/1/oklahoma-city) is from Google Project Sunroof which uses Google overhead imagery, weather station data, and machine learning algorithms to estimate rooftop solar potential of all buildings within the US

- **Income Data** found [here](https://www.ffiec.gov/censusapp.htm) is from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and maintains income-related census data available for download

# **Hypothesis Testing: California**
## Solar Saturation 
### Hypotheses:
- Null Hypothesis: The true difference in mean solar saturation between lower income and higher income census tracts is equal to 0.
- Alternative Hypothesis: The true difference in mean solar saturation between lower income and higher income census tracts is not equal to 0.

## Solar Saturation
### Hypotheses:
- Null Hypothesis: The true difference in mean solar saturation between lower income and higher income census tracts is equal to 0.
- Alternative Hypothesis: The true difference in mean solar saturation between lower income and higher income census tracts is not equal to 0.

### Results:
- lower income mean solar saturation: **2.62%** saturated
- higher income mean solar saturation: **6.65%** saturated
- 95% confidence interval: **3.64% - 4.22%** difference in means
- p-value: < **2.2e-16**

## Number of Buildings
### Hypotheses:
- Null Hypothesis: The true difference in mean buildings with solar between lower income census tracts and higher income census tracts is equal to 0.
- Alternative Hypothesis: The true difference in mean buildings with solar between lower income census tracts and higher income census tracts is not equal to 0.

- Alternative Hypothesis: The true difference in mean buildings with solar between lower income census tracts and higher income census tracts is not equal to 0.

### Results:
- lower income mean buildings with solar: **26** buildings
- higher income mean buildings with solar: **54** buildings
- 95% confidence interval: **25 - 30** difference in means
- p-value: < **2.2e-16**

# **What does it all mean?**
###Bad News:
- this means we see more affluent neighborhoods with solar

# **What does it all mean?**
###Bad News:
- this means we see more affluent neighborhoods with solar

###Good News:
- there is still a lot of potential for rooftop solar!
- if we reform policy correctly, we can facilitate equitable solar and cleaner energy
